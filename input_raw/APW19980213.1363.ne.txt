<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAGHDAD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>) _ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s deputy foreign minister attacked
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> National Security Advisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Berger</ENAMEX> Friday, accusing him of
``lies and deception.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riyadh al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> picked his way through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>'s press conference
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> hours earlier, criticizing the security advisor's
assertion that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> had been repeatedly in ``material breach'' of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Security Council</ENAMEX> resolutions.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> challenges (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>) to produce one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX>
resolution using those two words,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> told reporters in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>.
He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> might not have been concerned with reality,
because he had indicated that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> did not have the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX>'s unanimous support for a military strike, it
would go ahead anyway.
``Everybody knows that under the charter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>,
the five permanent members have a special responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security and there are three
permanent members _ namely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> _ who do not
want war, so unanimity does not exist,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> said.
The deputy foreign minister accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> of being part of a
campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
``This campaign is being conducted on the basis of lies and
deception and should not be taken by anyone in the world as being a
justifiable basis for war.''
``This is exactly what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, as supported by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, are trying to achieve.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> took issue with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>'s saying that any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> strike
would be aimed at eliminating ``the threat of the use of weapons of
mass destruction by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> ``considers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNSCOM</ENAMEX> to be the body responsible for making
such a determination,'' he said, referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Special
Commission</ENAMEX> whose inspectors are charged with searching for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s
mass destruction weapons.
``To my mind, and to that of my government, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNSCOM</ENAMEX> has not made
any reference to an existing threat, as of now, by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> against its
neighbors on account of the existence of weapons of mass
destruction. Its reports indicate the contrary.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> also criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> Foreign Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Cook</ENAMEX>
for saying earlier this week that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> posed a threat because it
still possessed weapons of mass destruction.
``Nothing can be further from the truth. He should check
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNSCOM</ENAMEX>'s report.''
Referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> threat to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> if it
does not give unfettered access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> inspectors, whom <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE"><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX></ENAMEX>
has barred from a number of suspected weapons sites on grounds of
national sovereignty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> said the two powers were not seeking
to reinforce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Commission</ENAMEX>.
``The objective is not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNSCOM</ENAMEX>. The objective is to use military
force per se.''
The deputy foreign minister spelled out the location of the
eight presidential sites that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has offered to open up to
inspectors appointed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
He said three of the sites were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>, three were
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salah-Eddine</ENAMEX> (an area near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>'s home town
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tikrit</ENAMEX>, north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>), one was in the northern region of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ninawa</ENAMEX> (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mosul</ENAMEX>), and one was in the southern city of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Basra</ENAMEX>.
It was first time that a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX> official had identified
the eight sites.

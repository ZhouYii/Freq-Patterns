<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNITED NATIONS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>) _ Alarmed over new violence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Leone</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX> appealed Friday to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigerian</ENAMEX>-led <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">African</ENAMEX>
intervention force to allow speedy delivery of humanitarian aid now
that that its troops have captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West African</ENAMEX> nation's
capital.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigerian</ENAMEX>-led force launched an attack last week to unseat
the military junta and restore the country's elected president,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Tejan Kabbah</ENAMEX>, who was ousted last May in a bloody coup.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigerian</ENAMEX>-led troops captured large parts of the center of the
capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freetown</ENAMEX>, on Thursday. Civilians reportedly celebrated in
the streets.
The events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Leone</ENAMEX> were deeply embarrassing to the
council, however. Although the 15 members had called for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kabbah</ENAMEX>'s
restoration, they had never authorized the use of force.
Instead, the council had endorsed an agreement reached last year
for a peaceful restoration of the elected government by April 22.
Foreign ministers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West African</ENAMEX> countries involved in the
peacekeeping force had visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> headquarters last week but gave
no indication they were about to launch a bid to overthrow the
junta.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX> expressed its concern over the very
unstable situation in parts of the country and over the heavy
civilian losses which have been reported,'' council President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denis
Dangue Rewaka</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gabon</ENAMEX> told reporters after a meeting.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX> has emphasized that international
humanitarian law must be upheld,'' he added. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX>
called for the humanitarian assistance to be activated immediately,
including cross-border operations, and for full, unrestricted
access to the people in need.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dangue Rewaka</ENAMEX> also said the council urged protection of
international aid workers and steps to return the country to
stability. It urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigerian</ENAMEX>-led force ``to cooperate fully''
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> ``with the view of rapid evaluation of the
situation on the ground.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dangue Rewaka</ENAMEX> refused to say whether the council felt
embarrassed by the failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West African</ENAMEX> foreign ministers to
notify them in advance of the campaign.
But he noted that the council had never authorized the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West
Africans</ENAMEX> to use force to oust the junta. He acknowledged that the
council was ``concerned by the use of force.''
During the meeting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> humanitarian coordinator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sergio de
Mello</ENAMEX>, said about 250,000 people had been displaced by the
fighting. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Mello</ENAMEX> said the situation was ``dramatic, not only in
the area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freetown</ENAMEX>'' but elsewhere in the country.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West African</ENAMEX> force intervened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Leone</ENAMEX> soon after the
junta led by Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Koroma</ENAMEX> toppled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kabbah</ENAMEX>. After bombarding
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freetown</ENAMEX> in a failed attempt to drive the junta from power, the
force blockaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freetown</ENAMEX>'s port to prevent food, fuel and other
necessities from reaching the city.
Despite international criticism of its human-rights record,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> _ apparently trying to improve its image and its clout in
the region _ has become a self-appointed protector of democracy in
parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>.

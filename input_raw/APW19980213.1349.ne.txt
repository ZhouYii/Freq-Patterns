<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AMSTERDAM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>) _ Legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dutch</ENAMEX> soccer club <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajax
Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is planning to seek a listing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdam stock
exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dutch</ENAMEX> media reported Friday, citing reliable sources.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajax</ENAMEX> declined comment, but a meeting has been called Monday for
club members to discuss the future, club sources told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dutch</ENAMEX> NOS
and RTL news programs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajax</ENAMEX>, currently leading the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dutch</ENAMEX> league and a quarter finalist
in the UEFA Cup, would become the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dutch</ENAMEX> soccer club to float
itself on the stock exchange in a move that would likely generate
millions of guilders (dollars) in extra revenue.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajax</ENAMEX> has long been one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Europe</ENAMEX>'s most successful
clubs, it has never spent heavily on the transfer market, instead
relying on its world famous youth development program to turn out
home-grown stars.
In the past the scheme has produced players including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johan
Cruyff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arsenal</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Bergkamp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC Milan</ENAMEX> striker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick
Kluivert</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajax</ENAMEX> has won the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dutch</ENAMEX> league a record 26 times and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">European</ENAMEX>
soccer's greatest prize, the European Cup, four times.
Any move to the stock exchange is expected to be led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajax</ENAMEX>'s
main sponsor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dutch</ENAMEX> bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABN Amro</ENAMEX>. Sources at the bank also
declined to comment on a planned listing.

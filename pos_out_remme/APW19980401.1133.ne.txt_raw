AS Asian currency grapple with their diminished value , foreign exchange -LRB- forex -RRB- dealer be scurry around to take long position in the currency of developed nation , particularly the US Dollar and the Pound Sterling . The enthusiasm come at a time when most currency in Asia , from industrialised country like Japan and South Korea right down to develop nation like Indonesian and Malaysia suffer a 30 % to 40 % defacto devaluation across the board . Forex and currency trading , quite lackadaisical particularly in the South East Asian region in last few year , escalate tremendously somewhere in the middle of this year a currency attack sweep across Asia , put many of it economy in dire strait . ` The safe and high return in currency investment for next year , base on the current circumstance be the greenback and the Pound Sterling . They have low risk and and considerably good interest and capital gain , ' say a Kuala Lumpur-based forex dealer . The stellar position of these two currency be attribute to the steady growth rate in the United States and the United Kingdom , compare with the figure see in the rest of Europe and other developed nation like Japan . The latter recently admit that it economic growth have stall and it would virtually be impossible for the country to grow at even one per cent for this year . The dealer add that although interest rate in Southeast Asia be on an upward trend , culminate from the currency depreciation , the currency of this region hold a high risk premium associate with the uncertainty that shroud the region . ` At the moment , most people be adopt a defensive trading strategy . Although interest yield in the regional currency be good than those in the Unites States and United Kingdom , the risk factor be more pronounced due to the instability , ' say another dealer . The risk he be refer to be a low capital yield if the currency be to depreciate . If the fall in value be substantial , the interest gain could be wipe out by the capital loss . However , not all market observer will vouch for the performance of the greenback and Pound Sterling next year . A treasurer in a local bank say that next year be go to be rather complicate . In 1998 , the European Monetary Union -LRB- EMU -RRB- will decide which country in the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- will qualify for it single currency unit , Euro , due to be launch in January 1999 . He point out that there will be a lot of speculation a the currency scramble to find it true value . The dilemma now be how the Euro will be receive in the market and it effect on the Pound Sterling , which be oust from the EMU after it take a severe beating in 1992 . The treasurer believe that if there be more interest show in the single currency , the Pound Sterling may start lose ground and find it strength falter . However , there be several uncertainty that need to be iron out first . The EMU will have to determine who will participate in the euro . To conserve the currency 's strength , one criterion be that inflation in the individual EU country should not exceed 1.5 percentage point above the three best perform nation . To date , six country qualify . Then , there be the question of conversion rate from individual currency to the euro . For instance , the Franc may have a different conversion rate to the euro compare with the Deutche Mark . All of this will ultimately determine the trading volatility in the euro . As the single unit come into be , there may be high volatility in the individual European currency market . The market 's reaction depend on a slew of factor and if it be sceptical about the implementation of the euro , heavy trading will find the value of the continent 's currency erode . ` However , there will not be very much impact for the time be a the euro , upon it inception , will have limit usage , ' say a trader . In the initial stage , the currency will be mainly utilise a a currency exchange mechanism rather than a monetary unit 's conventional role a the tool for the exchange for good and service . Another trader have his reservation about the US Dollar 's performance in1998 . ` The Dow Jones be currently buoyant and many predict that the bubble may burst next year , ' he say . Trading at above 8,000 point , some analyst see the 25 time Price-Earnings Ratio -LRB- PER -RRB- of the New York Stock Exchange -LRB- NYSE -RRB- , with certain individual counter exceed 30 time , be see a a sign of an overvalue market . ` When the chip start fall down , you will see the Dollar lose it grip because of a possible capital flight from the US , ' say a locally-based trader . He add that this may mean that fund will find it way back to this region , give it currency a lift . What be the Ringgit 's outlook like in 1998 ? Money market observer and economist interview by Investors Digest believe the Ringgit 's rebound will not solely depend on the development at home , but also those in the entire Asian region . This be because the restoration of foreign investor ' confidence in these market will work wonder for their currency . They agree that the Ringgit 's depreciation vis-a-vis major currency across the board be a spinoff from the current event that occur in Asia . ` We be affect by our neighbour , ' say one observer . Indeed , the recent state of affair envelop the financial sector of Japan , South Korea , Indonesia and Thailand have a ripple effect on Malaysia . The Asian turmoil have claim a number of unexpected victim , include Japan 's Yamaichi Securities , the country 's fourth large broking house . Besides that , six merchant bank in South Korea and 56 financial institution in Thailand be close . South Korea , Thailand and Indonesia be currently be assist by an International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- rescue package . These development have a major effect on the Ringgit 's prospect . ` There will be a slight improvement in the Ringgit , provide the dust in the Asian region settle . If it do n't , for instance , if the IMF bailout fail , then we can expect another wave of attack on the currency , ' an economist elucidate . Although most observer be not very bullish about the Ringgit 's performance in 1998 , they believe it will fare well than it do this year mainly because it be presently undervalue . The currency be currently trade at a range of RM3 .60 to RM3 .70 against the greenback . Says one observer , ` It be even possible for the Ringgit to go down temporarily to RM4 .00 , but it will surge again soon after . ` He add that 1998 will be a year of consolidation for the currency . Most observer opine that the Ringgit 's fair value should be somewhere in the region of RM3 .00 to RM3 .50 against the greenback , take into account trade figure and the overall weakness in the regional economy . As for 1997 , the Ringgit 's high be about RM2 .465 in January and a historical low of RM3 .885 in December , vis-a-vis the US Dollar . Our local unit however rebound sharply to RM3 .723 after Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announce a spate of additional austerity measure to address the Malaysian economic problem . It have rise far to breach the RM3 .65 level . Will the currency continue to track this upward movement into 1998 ? A market observer believe that the rally take place because of Anwar 's announcement and the fund go back to the Malaysian market . However , analyst point out the fact that the belt-tightening measure and the revise Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- rate to about four to five per cent in 1998 will slow down the country 's growth . Companies with a high exposure to the US Dollar , like Tenaga Nasional Bhd -LRB- TNB -RRB- , will see their profit come down . Says a forex dealer , ` Some multinationals have announce that they will cut production due to high cost and with reduce foreign direct investment -LRB- FDI -RRB- , the Ringgit will probably remain at the RM3 .60 to RM3 .70 level . ` However , factor such a the Commonwealth Games to be hold in September next year can provide a temporary boost to the currency . ` When tourist flock the country for the game , their expenditure here will create demand for the Ringgit , and we will see the currency appreciate , ' he say . However , how substantial the Ringgit 's value increase will depend on the quantum of demand create for it . An economist in Kuala Lumpur point out that any positive implication from the game will only be reflect in the third or fourth quarter of the year . ` It may not be substantive enough to outweigh the overall weakness in the Ringgit throughout the year , a the Commonwealth Games be a one-off event , ' he add . He believe that next year , the Ringgit should trade at the RM3 .20 to RM3 .50 level to remain competitive . ` If the Ringgit appreciate to this level , it will be good because it help to cushion off import bill and will not hit our export , ' he explain . As other currency in the region have also depreciate , a sharp rise in the Ringgit could impede Malaysia </ENAMEX> 's export . What role can interest rate play in the Ringgit 's value ? Very little , accord analyst . Traditionally , interest rate in a country be hike to support an ailing currency by attract short-term capital . However , the Southeast Asian </ENAMEX> region have buck the trend . ` Interest rate in Indonesia </ENAMEX> and Thailand </ENAMEX> have rise significantly but their currency be still weak because there be not enough investor confidence , ' say a treasurer in a foreign bank . In Malaysia </ENAMEX> , interest rate be currently at 9.09 % while the base lending rate -LRB- BLR -RRB- have jump up over three basis point to be in the region of more than 10 % . These hike be not use a a tool to shore up the Ringgit 's value but instead to curb inflation and credit growth . Besides , interest rate tend to rise in an environment with a general shortage of fund . The Ringgit 's performance in 1998 hinge greatly on the stability of the regional currency and the fate of the European </ENAMEX> currency and the US </ENAMEX> Dollar . As one analyst put it , ` The Ringgit will definitely pull through when there be more investor ' confidence in the region .

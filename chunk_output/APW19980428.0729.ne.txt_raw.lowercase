 brussels, belgium (ap) - some 2,500 credit lyonnais employees demonstrated tuesday outside european union headquarters to protest against conditions the eu wants to impose on french government subsidies to the troubled state bank. union representatives met with officials of the eu commission. after several hours, they walked out saying talks had been completely unproductive. ``the commission won't budge,'' said georges begot of the cfdt union. ``there is still some room for negotiation but it seems very limited.'' the commission has powers to veto or impose conditions on government subsidies if it judges they distort fair competition within the 15-nation bloc. the eu executive wants credit lyonnais to sell off all european assets outside france and reduce its french network. the commission says the french government should sell the bank to the best bidder by the end of 1999. the french government and the eu have been battling for years over billions of francs (dollars) aid given to credit lyonnais since the bank incurred heavy losses in the 1980s. last month, the bank reported net profits of 1.1 billion french francs (dlrs 180 million) in 1997. but the eu's top competition watchdog, karel van miert, said the results contained an illegal government subsidy of more than 3 billion francs (dlrs 490 million.) french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn said last week france will sell credit lyonnais by the end of next year. credit lyonnais has shed several thousand jobs over the past 10 years, but still employs 32,000 people. the protesters blamed job losses on eu interference. ``france is paying (for the bank). why does the eu have to interfere?'' said marie-claude latte, who has worked at credit lyonnais for 28 years. ``we've made sacrifices: we've had to accept longer working hours and less money,'' she added, waving one of her paychecks.

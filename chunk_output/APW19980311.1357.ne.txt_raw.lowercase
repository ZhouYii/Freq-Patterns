 sorrento, italy (ap) _ the season debut of tour of france winner jan ullrich was short-lived wednesday as the flu-weakened german withdrew during the opening stage of the tirreno-adriatico race. ullrich, who stopped pedaling one hour into the race, said he was confident he would recover his health and form by the start of the milan-to-san remo classic _ the first race of the 1998 world cup scheduled along the italian riviera on march 21. young italian gabriele balducci took the first of eight stages of the tirreno-adriatico _ a 133-kilometer (83-mile) circuit around sorrento _ outsprinting the pack at the finish line. a five-second bonus from the stage victory also gave balducci the overall leadership. despite the double victory, the italian was unhappy with narrow roads and slippery asphalt, and had a public argument with the race organizers. the stage was marred by several spills. the most serious, in the final kilometers, sent italian cyclist paolo bettini to the hospital with several bruises and a cut lip. ``the course was dangerous and risky. let's hope the next stages are scheduled on safer roads,'' balducci said. balducci, who completed the stage in three hours, 27.55 minutes, edged denmark's lars michaelsen at the finish line. another dane, veteran rolf sorensen, placed fourth, behind italy's roberto petito. thursday's second stage of 164 kilometers (103 miles) will take cyclists from sorrento to baia domizia. the tirreno-adriatico, the opening event of the italian cycling season which is considered a warmup for the milan-to-san remo, crosses central italy from the tyrrhenian to the adriatic sea.

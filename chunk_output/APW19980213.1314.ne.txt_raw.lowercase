 nassau, bahamas (ap) _ britain and some of its caribbean colonies clashed over london's insistence that the islands abolish the death penalty as a step towards closer relations, delegates to a caribbean forum said friday. foreign secretary robin cook, who attended the united kingdom-caribbean forum in nassau, has urged the colonies to join the labor government in abolishing the death penalty. cook made the appeal in a feb. 4 speech in which he said britain was considering granting full citizenship to its colonies. toward closer ties, the colonies also are getting their own minister, a forum for annual top-level consultations, and a new name _ ``overseas territories'' _ reflecting they are self-governing rather than dependent. ``they are saying we must eliminate the death penalty. but we had a referendum and people voted for it to remain,'' bermuda premier pamela gordon said friday. other delegates said the former british colonies of belize and trinidad and tobago were upset that the death penalty issue was included in a working session on human rights on thursday. british officials had no immediate comment on the discussions. some caribbean countries beset by an increasing number of drug-related murders have tried to use the death penalty. but they have been obstructed by the privy council in london, the highest appeals court for several former and current british colonies. in 1993, the privy council ruled it was inhumane to execute prisoners who had waited on death row for more than five years. it recommended that inmates who exceed that period have their sentences commuted to life in prison. the ruling effectively ended hangings in many caribbean countries, where appeals cases sometimes drag on for a decade. delegates from some former colonies have suggested they will act on longstanding plans to create their own supreme court and cut their ties to the privy council. ``human rights mean different things to different countries, and for us in the caribbean we have made it clear we don't want anybody lecturing us about human rights,'' said guyanese foreign minister clement rohee.

 	   copenhagen, denmark (ap) _ prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen on thursday made a suprise announcement of national elections to be held march 11. 	   although elections were required to be held by september, most had expected they would be delayed until after the may 28 plebiscite on the european union's latest treaty. 	   nyrup rasmussen interrupted an ordinary parliament session to announce the elections, saying ``big and important decisions lie ahead,'' a clear reference to the plebiscite. 	   danes are known for their lukewarm attitude about eu membership and many are concerned that accepting the latest eu treaty would require denmark to give up too much sovereignty. 	   nyrup rasmussen said another major topic was to lower the total government debt of 711.6 billion kroner (dlrs 104.6 4 billion). 	   the government coalition including nyrup rasmussen's social democratic party and the small center radical party did not resign. the two groups hold 70 of parliament's 179 seats _ 20 short of the 90 required for majority. 	   radical party leader marianne jelved told reporters the purpose of the elections was to ask for voters' support to continue the government's policy to ``enable us to continue into the next century.'' 	   ``denmark today has a stronger economy, a better employment policy and a more equitable distribution of the benefits than most other countries in europe,'' nyrup rasmussen said. 	   unemployment is at 7.4 percent of the labor force _ one of the lowest in europe _ and the 1997 growth was of 2.2 percent. 	   nyrup rasmussen became prime minister in 1993, after a decade with conservative-liberal governments. his first four-party cabinet controlled 90 parliamentary seats and became the first majority government in more than 20 years. 	   since then, two parties dropped out, making it a minority government whose parliamentary survival was assured by a small center party and two left-wing groups. 	   the prime minister said he would ``be a beast if i didn't say 'yes of course''' about calling the elections now that the liberal-conservative opposition is weak. 	   the conservatives have been divided by internal fights in almost a year, while their liberal ally has dived slightly in recent polls. 	   a recent opinion poll indicated the social democrats would win only 56 parliamentary seats _ six less than they currently holds 	   (jo-jh)

 amsterdam, netherlands (ap) _ storied dutch soccer club ajax amsterdam is planning to seek a listing on the amsterdam stock exchange, dutch media reported friday, citing ``reliable sources.'' ajax declined comment, but a meeting has been called monday for club members to discuss the future, club sources told the dutch nos and rtl news programs. ajax, currently leading the dutch league and a quarter finalist in the uefa cup, would become the first dutch soccer club to float itself on the stock exchange in a move that would likely generate millions of guilders (dlrs) in extra revenue. although ajax has long been one of europe's most successful clubs, it has never spent heavily on the transfer market, instead relying on its world famous youth development program to turn out home-grown stars. in the past the scheme has produced players including johan cruyff, arsenal's dennis bergkamp and ac milan striker patrick kluivert. ajax has won the dutch league a record 26 times and european soccer's greatest prize, the european cup, four times. any move to the stock exchange is expected to be led by ajax's main sponsor, the dutch bank abn amro. sources at the bank also declined to comment on a planned listing.

 	   tbilisi, georgia (ap) _ kidnappers seized four united nations military observers in the former soviet republic of georgia on thursday, but police quickly tracked down and surrounded the armed gang. 	   the abductors demanded that the government free seven people arrested for allegedly taking part in the last week's failed attempt to kill president eduard shevardnadze. 	   traveling in two cars, the kidnappers abducted the observers and stole one of their vehicles in the western georgia town of zugdidi, police said. 	   several hours later, police encircled a house where the kidnappers and the hostages were holed up in the village of dzhikhaskari, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, georgia's interior minister kakha targamadze said. 	   security officials placed armored military vehicles outside the house and began negotiations with the kidnappers, the interior minister added. 	   the kidnap victims included two observers from uruguay, one from sweden and one from the czech republic, along with their georgian driver, according to the u.n. office. 	   the uruguayans were identified as captains ronald garcia and julio navas, and the swede as maj. maaren moelgaard. the identities of the others were not immediately known. 	   the interior minister said the kidnappers were supporters of former president zviad gamsakhurdia, who was ousted in 1992 and who died under mysterious circumstances in 1994. 	   the kidnappers said they would free their hostages only if authorities release all seven gamsakhurdia supporters arrested in recent days for alleged involvement in a feb. 9 assassination attempt against shevardnadze. 	   two of shevardnadze's bodyguards were killed in last week's attack, as was one of the assailants, but the president was unharmed. 	   the u.n. observers are in georgia to monitor the truce between government forces and separatists in the northwest province of abkhazia. the separatists took control of the province in a 1992-3 war. 	   the u.n. team, along with russian forces, have helped prevent further outbreaks of fighting, but there has been no real progress toward a political settlement.

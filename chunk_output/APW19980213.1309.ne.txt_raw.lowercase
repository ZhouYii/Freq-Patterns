 santo domingo, dominican republic (ap) _ dominican authorities have arrested a doctor sought by u.s. authorities for defrauding the medicare system for millions of dollars while practicing in new york. the arrest of the politically well-connected dr. rafael gonzalez pantaleon represents another step by dominican authorities toward increased cooperation with the united states, which is seeking extradition of numerous suspects hiding out in their home country. gonzalez pantaleon, a former government official and political party leader in this caribbean nation, was convicted in new york in 1996 of defrauding medicare of dlrs 20 million. he was sentenced to six and one-half years in prison and fined dlrs 5 million, but he fled the united states while free on bail. officials said gonzalez pantaleon was arrested thursday, one day after u.s. undersecretary of state john hamilton met with president leonel fernandez to ask for the extradition of 30 drug trafficking and murder suspects believed to be in the dominican republic. extradition of dominicans is a controversial topic made more complicated by conflicting laws. while a 1910 treaty permits extradition, a law passed in 1969 prohibits dominicans from being turned over to other nations. but the latter law did not abolish the previous treaty. fernandez has urged a new law be passed to clear up the conflict. last year, fernandez</enamex> handed over to u.s.</enamex> authorities two suspects accused in u.s.</enamex> courts of multiple murders, drug trafficking and conspiracy. fernandez</enamex> justified the extraditions by saying that the country could not become a haven for fleeing felons.

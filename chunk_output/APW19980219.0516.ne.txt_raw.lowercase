 	   dura, west bank (ap) _ israeli policemen fired live rounds in the air thursday to disperse hundreds of young palestinians who blocked a major west bank road to show their support for saddam hussein. 	   the confrontation began when elementary and high school students marched and burned israeli and u.s. flags in dura, a west bank town that remains under israeli security control. 	   at one point, the marchers blocked the main road running through dura with boulders, and hurled rocks at an israeli police van and settler cars. the four policemen in the van called for backup and then fired in the air with pistols and assault rifles. 	   three more vans and an israeli army jeep arrived a few minutes later. there were no immediate reports of injury. 	   after a while, the shooting stopped and israeli soldiers began firing tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators. troops chased stone throwers into the fields. two palestinians were injured by rubber bullets and six were overcome by tear gas. 	   the incident marked the most serious confrontation between israeli troops and palestinians since pro-iraq demonstrations began in the west bank several weeks ago. 	   the rallies often ended in stone throwing clashes, but until now israeli troops have fired only rubber bullets, not live ammunition. the palestinian authority has banned pro-iraq rallies, but that ban has been widely ignored. 	   the palestinian authority has also prohibited palestinian radio and television stations from broadcasting commentary in support of saddam or footage of demonstrations. the ban came under pressure from the united states. 	   palestinian leader yasser arafat, who paid a heavy price for his open support of saddam during the 1991 gulf war, has been carefully neutral in his statements, saying he would like to see a diplomatic solution to the conflict. 	   in the west bank town of ramallah, palestinian police prevented a planned pro-iraq rally by the palestinian professionals' union. police told organizers they would be breaking the law if they went ahead and the marchers left quietly. 	   the march in dura began thursday morning with about 800 school students waving iraqi and palestinian flags and urging saddam hussein to fire missiles at israel. 	   ``with our spirit and our blood, we will redeem iraq,'' and ``saddam, saddam, our beloved, hit tel aviv,'' shouted the about 800 elementary and high school students. 	   demonstrators burned six israeli and two u.s. flags and several held up a banner reading ``why do the iraqi people have to pay the price for clinton's affairs?''

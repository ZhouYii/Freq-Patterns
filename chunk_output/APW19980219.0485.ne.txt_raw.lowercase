 	   rome (ap) _ the italian government will ask u.s. authorities for jurisdiction in probing the role of the four-man crew of the marine jet which severed a ski gondola cable, justice minister giovanni maria flick told the chamber of deputies thursday. 	   by snapping the cable, the jet, on a training run feb. 3 from the u.s. air base of aviano, in northeast italy, sent the cable car smashing into a mountain at an alpine resort, killing all 20 aboard the gondola. 	   if italy receives jurisdiction and decides to indict the crew, the four could stand trial on charges of multiple manslaughter and endangering transport. 	   the crew returned safely to base after the accident and expressed sympathy in a statement to the victim's families. 	   under nato's 1951 status of forces agreement, italy may make such a request, and ``the u.s. will give full consideration'' to the request, said an aviano spokesman, tech. sgt. bill lincicome. 	   but the chances that u.s. authorities will let the italians decide the judicial fate of the crew seemed slim. 	   lincicome noted that there has been no precedent for a nato member surrendering jurisdiction in a probe involving the carrying out of official duty. 	   italy's request will be made in the next few days via the foreign ministry. 	   italy was seeking jurisdiction, flick told the deputies, given the gravity of the tragedy and ``the enormous impression on the italian population, which has shown the strong desire that justice be carried out in our country.'' 	   the request comes at a sensitive time, with some small leftist parties which support premier romano prodi's government opposing u.s. use of italian or nato bases in italy should there be a strike against iraq. 	   flick said the request took into consideration the ``loyal and reciprocal cooperation between the italian and u.s. authorities.'' 	   the minister indicated that italy might ask jurisdiction to probe the role of other americans attached to aviano, but that a final decision hadn't been made on that. 	   italian and american militaries are conducting a joint investigation to determine whether any of the jet's crew or its commanding officers should face charges. 	   italian civilian prosecutors are conducting a separate investigation but will be powerless to try the crew unless american authorities give up jurisdiction. 	   on wednesday, italian news reports said that the jet was well below its approved altitude when the accident happened. 	   a team of experts appointed by an italian prosecutor, according to the news agency ansa, contends the ea-6b prowler sped between two sets of cables which were 260 feet (85 meters) from the ground at the lowest point and 400 feet (125 meters) at the highest. 	   the pentagon has acknowledged that a book used by u.s. military pilots specifically states that pilots in the area where the ski lift is located were to maintain a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet (300 meters). 	   flick said italy will advance the compensation for the victims, with the united states eventually reimbursing italy</enamex> for 75 percent of the costs.

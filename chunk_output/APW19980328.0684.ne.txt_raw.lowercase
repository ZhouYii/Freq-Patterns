 baghdad, iraq (ap) _ taking their search for weapons of mass destruction close to president saddam hussein's hometown, u.n. arms experts traveled to northern iraq saturday to inspect presidential palace compounds. a multinational group of 20 diplomats, mandated by a u.n.-iraq accord, accompanied the arms experts to the town of tikrit, 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of auja, the village where saddam was born on april 28, 1937. ``we had no reports of any problems at this stage,'' ewen buchanan, the spokesman for the inspectors, said by telephone from new york. ```they will continue with their schedule for the next week and they are on schedule.'' saddam has one palace in tikrit, one at jebel makhul, a mountain range some 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of tikrit and one near tharthar lake, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of tikrit. it was not immediately known which one of those the inspectors visited or how long the inspection lasted. state-run television on saturday showed hundreds of villagers shouting slogans of support for saddam as he visited villages near tikrit. in a speech, the iraqi leader made no mention of the current searches, which state-run media have also ignored. the palaces are among the eight that iraq had long kept off-limits from weapons inspectors, citing national sovereignty. when iraq refused to relent, the united states and britain threatened military strikes, raising the specter of war in february. the crisis was averted when iraq signed an accord with u.n. secretary-general kofi annan on feb. 23, pledging to open the palaces. in return, the united nations appointed the group of 20 diplomats to accompany the inspectors to all sensitive sites to safeguard iraq's dignity. the palace inspections began thursday with the radwaniyah complex outside baghdad. the total area of the eight palace compounds is 31.5 square kilometers (12.5 square miles), which comprise 1,058 buildings. the diplomats and the inspectors in tikrit also are expected to travel to mosul, the site of another palace 400 kilometers (235 miles) from baghdad during their three-day trip. they will return to baghdad on monday. tikrit, 170 kilometers (105 miles) from baghdad, is the heartland of iraq's ruling elite, which is dominated by minority sunni muslims. earlier saturday, the diplomats plus their leader, jayantha dhanapala of sri lanka, drove from their downtown hotel to the u.n. headquarters to team up with the arms experts at their office before leaving for the north. on friday, a minor surveying problem snagged the inspection but it was sorted out after talks between the u.n. team and iraqi deputy prime minister tariq aziz, antonio montiro, a portuguese diplomat, said. ``everything went smoothly. even when we had the problem, we were able to talk. that's why things were solved,'' montiro said. the inspectors' leader, american charles duelfer, stressed that it wasn't a significant problem. the inspectors must certify that iraq has dismantled its long-range missile program and its programs to build chemical and biological weapons before the u.n. security council will consider lifting the economic sanctions it imposed after iraq's 1990 invasion of kuwait. the sanctions have strangled iraq</enamex>'s economy. iraq</enamex> has insisted that has complied with the u.n.</enamex> resolutions and that any banned weapons have been destroyed and the programs to build them abolished.

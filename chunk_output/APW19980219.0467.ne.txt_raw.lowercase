 	   bucharest, romania (ap) _ outraged at the spectacle of young people kissing in a streetcar named for a 13th century crusader against pagan sleaze, the greek catholic church asked the government thursday to quash valentine's day celebrations. 	   ``from a christian point of view, this is a profanation of a martyr of virtue and chastity,'' tertulian langa, a greek catholic priest, told the ap by telephone. ``his name has been turned into a public orgy.'' 	   langa was referring to a feb. 14 stunt in a streetcar dubbed valentine, in which a justice of the peace married 20 young couples for the day. the event attracted a lot of media attention and helped popularize the holiday, recently introduced to formerly communist romania. 	   ``this streetcar has no sacred character and has nothing to do with his holiness. we are insulted,'' said langa from the greek catholic headquarters, some 325 kilometers (203 miles) northwest of bucharest. 	   langan said he had sent letters to five government ministries, requesting they ``undertake the necessary action to combat this degradation of public life.'' 	   in a different protest of the holiday, the mayor of cluj, gheorghe funar, refused a valentine's day gift of flowers, claiming such an act symbolized ``false capitalist values.'' 	   st. valentine was a roman priest and martyr who fought against pagan love fests. he was killed in rome in 270. 	   in the past couple of years, romanians</enamex> have begun exchanging bunches of flowers and small gifts on feb. 14, calling it ``lovers' day.''

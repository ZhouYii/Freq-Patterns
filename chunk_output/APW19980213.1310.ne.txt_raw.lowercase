 canberra, australia (ap) _ turning its back on 210 years of loyalty to the british royal family, a constitutional convention voted overwhelmingly friday to make australia a republic under its own president. prime minister john howard, a monarchist himself, promised to put the question to a national referendum next year after convention delegates voted 89-52 for a republic, with 11 abstentions. spontaneous applause echoed through the chamber and public galleries as the crucial vote passed by a wide margin. ``i want a referendum,'' howard said. ``the australian people are owed the opportunity of expressing an opinion on this.'' ``it would be a travesty in common sense terms of australian democracy for that proposition not to be put to the australian people,'' howard said. even in his own cabinet, howard is becoming increasingly isolated with his monarchist stance. treasurer peter costello, environment minister robert hill and attorney general daryl williams all voted to support the republic friday. ``this convention will be seen as a turning point in our history,'' australian republican movement spokeswoman mary delahunty said. pro-republicans hope to have an australian president by the opening of the 2000 olympics and the 100th anniversary of australian federation. calling for an amended constitution with a new preamble, to be written by australian poets, republican janet holmes a court said, ``we need the smell of eucalyptus in this, and the feel of red dust.'' monarchists hope to defeat the republic at the referendum. ``the phony war has finished and the real referendum campaign has clearly begun,'' australians for a constitutional monarchy executive director kerry jones said. ``well may we say `god save the queen,' for nothing will save the republic,'' outraged monarchist delegate david mitchell said. ``the idea of a republic will fall to dust through the grace of almighty god.'' polls have shown public support for a republic increasing, rising from about 35 percent several years ago to about 51 percent this year, as pro-monarchist sentiment diminishes. australia has been independent since 1901, but like many commonwealth nations it still recognizes the british monarch as its head of state. howard said queen elizabeth ii is taking a great interest in the convention. ``she is, i can assure you, from what i've been told, she's following the thing very closely and taking the view it's our business. ``it's no secret that she's indicated to me ... she is a 20th century democrat, understands that the role of the crown in australia rests in the hands of the australian people as it has for almost a hundred years.'' the model for a republic, adopted over bitter objections from those advocating direct election of a president, is for presidential nominations to be made with public input and the winning candidate decided by a two-thirds majority of parliament. former prime minister paul keating, who put the republic issue in the spotlight in his unsuccessful 1996 campaign for re-election, welcomed the result. ``this is an important step along the path towards australia claiming its full sovereignty, and due recognition that the monarchy can no longer serve us appropriately,'' keating said.

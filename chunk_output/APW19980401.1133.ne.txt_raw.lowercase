 as asian currencies grapple with their diminished value, foreign exchange (forex) dealers are scurrying around to take long positions in the currencies of developed nations, particularly the us dollar and the pound sterling. the enthusiasm comes at a time when most currencies in asia, from industrialised countries like japan and south korea right down to developing nations like indonesian and malaysia suffered a 30% to 40% defacto devaluation across the board. forex and currency trading, quite lackadaisical particularly in the south east asian region in last few years, escalated tremendously somewhere in the middle of this year as currency attacks swept across asia, putting many of its economies in dire straits. `the safest and highest returns in currency investments for next year, based on the current circumstances are the greenback and the pound sterling. they have low risks and and considerably good interest and capital gains,' says a kuala lumpur-based forex dealer.  the stellar position of these two currencies are attributed to the steady growth rates in the united states and the united kingdom, compared with the figures seen in the rest of europe and other developed nations like japan. the latter recently admitted that its economic growth has stalled and it would virtually be impossible for the country to grow at even one per cent for this year. the dealer adds that although interest rates in southeast asia are on an upward trend, culminating from the currency depreciation, the currencies of this region hold a high risk premium associated with the uncertainties that shroud the region. `at the moment, most people are adopting a defensive trading strategy. although interest yields in the regional currencies are better than those in the unites states and united kingdom, the risk factor is more pronounced due to the instability,' says another dealer.  the risk he is refering to is a lower capital yield if the currencies were to depreciate. if the fall in value is substantial, the interest gain could be wiped out by the capital losses.  however, not all market observers will vouch for the performance of the greenback and pound sterling next year. a treasurer in a local bank says that next year is going to be rather complicated.  in 1998, the european monetary union (emu) will decide which countries in the european union (eu) will qualify for its single currency unit, euro, due to be launched in january 1999.  he points out that there will be a lot of speculation as the currency scrambles to find its true value. the dilemma now is how the euro will be received in the market and its effect on the pound sterling, which was ousted from the emu after it took a severe beating in 1992. the treasurer believes that if there is more interest shown in the single currency, the pound sterling may start losing ground and find its strength faltering.  however, there are several uncertainties that need to be ironed out first. the emu will have to determine who will participate in the euro. to conserve the currency's strength, one criterion is that inflation in the individual eu countries should not exceed 1.5 percentage points above the three best performing nations. to date, six countries qualify. then, there is the question of conversion rates from individual currencies to the euro. for instance, the franc may have a different conversion rate to the euro compared with the deutche mark. all of this will ultimately determine the trading volatility in the euro. as the single unit comes into being, there may be high volatility in the individual european currencies market. the market's reaction depends on a slew of factors and if it is sceptical about the implementation of the euro, heavy trading will find the value of the continent's currencies eroding.  `however, there will not be very much impact for the time being as the euro, upon its inception, will have limited usage,' says a trader. in the initial stages, the currency will be mainly utilised as a currency exchange mechanism rather than a monetary unit's conventional role as the tool for the exchange for goods and services. another trader has his reservations about the us dollar's performance in1998. `the dow jones is currently buoyant and many predict that the bubble may burst next year,' he says. trading at above 8,000 points, some analysts see the 25 times price-earnings ratio (per) of the new york stock exchange (nyse), with certain individual counters exceeding 30 times, is seen as a sign of an overvalued market. `when the chips start falling down, you will see the dollar losing its grip because of a possible capital flight from the us,' says a locally-based trader. he adds that this may mean that funds will find its way back to this region, giving its currencies a lift.  what is the ringgit's outlook like in 1998? money market observers and economists interviewed by investors digest believe the ringgit's rebound will not solely depend on the developments at home, but also those in the entire asian region. this is because the restoration of foreign investors' confidence in these markets will work wonders for their currencies. they agree that the ringgit's depreciation vis-a-vis major currencies across the board is a spinoff from the current events that occured in asia. `we are affected by our neighbours,' says one observer. indeed, the recent state of affairs enveloping the financial sectors of japan, south korea, indonesia and thailand has a rippling effect on malaysia. the asian turmoil has claimed a number of unexpected victims, including japan's yamaichi securities, the country's fourth largest broking house. besides that, six merchant banks in south korea and 56 financial institutions in thailand were closed. south korea, thailand and indonesia are currently being assisted by an international monetary fund (imf) rescue package.  these developments have a major effect on the ringgit's prospects. `there will be a slight improvement in the ringgit, provided the dust in the asian region settles. if it doesn't, for instance, if the imf bailout fails, then we can expect another wave of attacks on the currency,' an economist elucidates. although most observers are not very bullish about the ringgit's performance in 1998, they believe it will fare better than it did this year mainly because it is presently undervalued. the currency is currently trading at a range of rm3.60 to rm3.70 against the greenback. says one observer, `it is even possible for the ringgit to go down temporarily to rm4.00, but it will surge again soon after.'he adds that 1998 will be a year of consolidation for the currency. most observers opine that the ringgit's fair value should be somewhere in the region of rm3.00 to rm3.50 against the greenback, taking into account trade figures and the overall weakness in the regional economies. as for 1997, the ringgit's high was about rm2.465 in january and a historical low of rm3.885 in december, vis-a-vis the us dollar.  our local unit however rebounded sharply to rm3.723 after deputy prime minister and finance minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim announced a spate of additional austerity measures to address the malaysian economic problems. it has risen further to breach the rm3.65 level. will the currency continue to track this upward movement into 1998? a market observer believed that the rally took place because of anwar's announcements and the funds went back to the malaysian market. however, analysts point out the fact that the belt-tightening measures and the revised gross domestic product (gdp) rate to about four to five per cent in 1998 will slow down the country's growth.  companies with a high exposure to the us dollar, like tenaga nasional bhd (tnb), will see their profits coming down.  says a forex dealer, `some multinationals have announced that they will cut production due to high costs and with reduced foreign direct investments (fdi), the ringgit will probably remain at the rm3.60 to rm3.70 level.'however, factors such as the commonwealth games to be held in september next year can provide a temporary boost to the currency. `when tourists flock the country for the games, their expenditure here will create demand for the ringgit, and we will see the currency appreciating,' he says.  however, how substantial the ringgit's value increases will depend on the quantum of demand created for it.  an economist in kuala lumpur points out that any positive implications from the games will only be reflected in the third or fourth quarter of the year. `it may not be substantive enough to outweigh the overall weakness in the ringgit throughout the year, as the commonwealth games is a one-off event,' he adds.  he believes that next year, the ringgit should trade at the rm3.20 to rm3.50 level to remain competitive. `if the ringgit appreciates to this level, it will be good because it helps to cushion off import bills and will not hit our exports,' he explains.  as other currencies in the region have also depreciated, a sharp rise in the ringgit could impede malaysia</enamex>'s exports.  what role can interest rates play in the ringgit's value? very little, according analysts. traditionally, interest rates in a country are hiked to support an ailing currency by attracting short-term capital. however, the southeast asian</enamex> region has bucked the trend.  `interest rates in indonesia</enamex> and thailand</enamex> have risen significantly but their currencies are still weak because there is not enough investor confidence,' says a treasurer in a foreign bank.  in malaysia</enamex>, interest rates are currently at 9.09% while the base lending rate (blr) has jumped up over three basis points to be in the region of more than 10%. these hikes are not used as a tool to shore up the ringgit's value but instead to curb inflation and credit growth. besides, interest rates tend to rise in an environment with a general shortage of funds. the ringgit's performance in 1998 hinges greatly on the stability of the regional currencies and the fate of the european</enamex> currencies and the us</enamex> dollar. as one analyst puts it, `the ringgit will definitely pull through when there is more investors' confidence in the region.

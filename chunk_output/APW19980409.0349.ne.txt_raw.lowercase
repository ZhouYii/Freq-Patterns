 amsterdam, netherlands (ap) _ dutch support for the death penalty is growing with a majority in favor of imposing it for serious crimes, including incest and child abuse, a new study shows. according to the latest survey of 3,000 people, one in two participants, or 52 percent, supports the death penalty, which was abolished in the netherlands in 1870. in previous surveys, support ranged between 40 and 45 percent. survey investigator dr. karin wittebrood said thursday it is difficult to establish what had triggered the increase, but timing may have been a factor. the study was conducted during the latter part of 1996 when publicity over the marc dutroux child-murder case in neighboring belgium reached its height and public concerns spilled over the border. wittebrood said many of those who support the death penalty said it should be imposed for murder, incest and child abuse. although the rise reflects a significant change in public opinion, wittebrood believes the change is only temporary in this tolerant country. the survey also showed that supporters of the death penalty are mostly young people or those with a low level of education. the survey, carried out by the netherlands institute for the study of crime and law enforcement, was conducted via face-to-face interviews. its margin of error was not disclosed.

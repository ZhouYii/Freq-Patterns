 zagreb, croatia (ap) _ amid efforts to crack down on its longtime debtors, croatia's state-run oil company friday confiscated 30,000 tons of oil products it had provided to a bosnian company, the state-run news agency hina reported. officials with the croatian oil company ina said the move was done for economic reasons, but it is likely to erode already-tense relations between the two neighbors. bosnia's state-owned oil company, energopetrol, owes ina dlrs 3.8 million. friday, ina confiscated 30,000 tons of oil and oil products it had provided to energopetrol. the bosnian company had not paid for the products stored in the southern croatian port of ploce. ``this was done suddenly, without any negotiations, discussions or warning,'' said aziz tukulj, director of domestic sales for energopetrol. ``my personal feeling is that this is pure bullying.'' energopetrol owes money to ina, tukulj said, but wasn't sure how much. he added that ina owes money to energopetrol and its parent company, energoinvest. he said contracts between the two companies require negotiations be undertaken to resolve disputes. a spokesman from ina could not be reached to confirm tukulj's comments. ina recently announced that it would start punishing debtors because unpaid bills totaling dlrs 141 million threaten its business. some debtors, like croatia's electric-power industry, airline and railway, promised to pay up immediately. it is doubtful whether bosnia, whose economy is in ruins after a devastating war, can pay its debts. tukulj said the confiscation will not create shortages in bosnia. but the move is likely to have political consequences. bosnia's muslim-led leadership was outraged by a recent speech by croatian president franjo tudjman, in which he justified his support for the wartime bosnian croat substate. bosnian leaders, as well as international officials, are leery of tudjman's intentions towards bosnia</enamex>. they interpreted his remarks as an indication of his continued desire to annex a part of bosnia</enamex>. in addition, the two countries have failed to agree on terms for bosnia</enamex> to lease part of the ploce</enamex> port. the confiscation by ina</enamex> ``looks like some kind of (political) pressure,'' tukulj</enamex> said.

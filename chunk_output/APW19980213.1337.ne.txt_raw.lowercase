 moscow (ap) _ the u.s.-russian split over iraq underlines how ties between moscow and washington have cooled as the russians try to reassert themselves as a world power. while there is no danger of reviving the cold war rivalry that dominated the world for more than 45 years, the diplomatic honeymoon that followed the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 is coming to an end. both moscow and washington value good relations, but there are likely to be more and more disagreements as russia goes its own way. russia's opposition to the use of force in iraq is the latest in a series of foreign policy disputes with the united states. moscow bitterly opposes nato expansion in east europe, and parliament has blocked the start ii missile-reduction treaty with washington. moscow also is building links with china, saying the world must not be dominated by the united states. president boris yeltsin and other top russian officials have unleashed a barrage of warnings on u.s. military strikes against iraq. yeltsin said last week a u.s. attack could lead to world war and his defense minister, igor sergeyev, publicly warned u.s. defense secretary william cohen in moscow against attacking iraq. at the heart of russia's opposition are two issues. on one level, the issue is mostly pragmatic. iraq, an old soviet client state, owes moscow billions of dollars for weapons that can't be paid until u.n. sanctions end. russia, its economy in chaos, desperately needs the cash and also hopes for big new contracts with iraq when sanctions end. the second issue, emotive and unpredictable, is russia's status in the world. many russians yearn for the days when moscow was the world's other superpower. the fact that russia has lost much of its power makes the need to play a major global role all the more pressing for many russian officials. and envy of its old rival, the united states, is rising as russia's power continues to decline. russian officials dismiss suggestions they would aid iraq against the united states. moscow backs united nations' efforts to strip iraq of weapons of mass production, but says only a diplomatic solution can work. foreign minister yevgeny primakov, who formed close ties in the middle east as a soviet diplomat, has pushed for a moscow-backed solution on iraq to help restore russian influence in the region. the russian government has neither the desire or power to risk a major confrontation with the united states. yeltsin considers good relations with washington a foundation of his foreign policy. but the russian government and many politicians will be stridently critical of the united states if they believe they are being ignored. and russian nationalists will use resentment of american power to boost their calls to revive russia as a great power. anti-american resentment has increased as the united states has tried to influence russian policy through economic leverage _ particularly in the hard-line parliament. some american officials concede that washington should be more careful about russian sensibilities. moscow should be courted as an ally, they say, lending support to democratic government in russia. ``i think it does reflect a sense here of resentment of being ordered around, which in some cases i think our government has done in a way that is not productive,'' u.s. ambassador james collins said recently. ---- editor's note: barry renfrew is the ap</enamex>'s moscow</enamex> bureau chief.

 oslo, norway (ap) _ israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is to discuss the deadlocked middle east peace process in a three-day visit to norway next week, officials said friday. the prospects for resuscitating the peace process have appeared grim lately, but any visits by middle east officials to the country that guided the 1993 peace agreement raise speculation that a breakthrough may be in the works. ``norway has a central role in the peace process, and we obviously will do what we can to contribute to the process going further,'' norwegian foreign ministry spokesman ingvard havnen told the norwegian news agency ntb. netanyahu's visit is to run march 6-8, when he will meet both with prime minister kjell magne bondevik and with foreign minister knut vollebaek, israeli embassy second secretary johnathan meidan told the associated press. although the secret ``oslo channel'' talks that brought about the israel-plo peace agreement were conducted under the former social democrat-led government, the new government that took power in october is deeply interested in continuing its middle east influence. both vollebaek and bondevik have visited israel since the government took power, and terje roed-larsen, a key figure in the 1993 process, was appointed last month as the new government's special envoy for the middle east. a senior u.s. diplomat assured palestinian leader yasser arafat on thursday that washington was resuming efforts to break the mideast deadlock, palestinian officials said. the united states has asked israel and the palestinians to respond to a proposal that israel withdraw from 13.1 percent of the west bank over 12 weeks. the withdrawal would take place in three small stages, and each stage would be accompanied by palestinian</enamex> security gestures.

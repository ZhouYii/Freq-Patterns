 united nations (ap) _ alarmed over new violence in sierra leone, the security council appealed friday to the nigerian-led african intervention force to allow speedy delivery of humanitarian aid now that that its troops have captured the west african nation's capital. the nigerian-led force launched an attack last week to unseat the military junta and restore the country's elected president, ahmed tejan kabbah, who was ousted last may in a bloody coup. nigerian-led troops captured large parts of the center of the capital, freetown, on thursday. civilians reportedly celebrated in the streets. the events in sierra leone were deeply embarrassing to the council, however. although the 15 members had called for kabbah's restoration, they had never authorized the use of force. instead, the council had endorsed an agreement reached last year for a peaceful restoration of the elected government by april 22. foreign ministers of the west african countries involved in the peacekeeping force had visited u.n. headquarters last week but gave no indication they were about to launch a bid to overthrow the junta. ``the security council expressed its concern over the very unstable situation in parts of the country and over the heavy civilian losses which have been reported,'' council president denis dangue rewaka of gabon told reporters after a meeting. ``the security council has emphasized that international humanitarian law must be upheld,'' he added. ``the security council called for the humanitarian assistance to be activated immediately, including cross-border operations, and for full, unrestricted access to the people in need.'' dangue rewaka also said the council urged protection of international aid workers and steps to return the country to stability. it urged the nigerian-led force ``to cooperate fully'' with the united nations ``with the view of rapid evaluation of the situation on the ground.'' dangue rewaka refused to say whether the council felt embarrassed by the failure of west african foreign ministers to notify them in advance of the campaign. but he noted that the council had never authorized the west africans to use force to oust the junta. he acknowledged that the council was ``concerned by the use of force.'' during the meeting, the u.n. humanitarian coordinator, sergio de mello, said about 250,000 people had been displaced by the fighting. de mello said the situation was ``dramatic, not only in the area of freetown'' but elsewhere in the country. the west african force intervened in sierra leone soon after the junta led by maj. johnny koroma toppled kabbah. after bombarding freetown in a failed attempt to drive the junta from power, the force blockaded freetown's port to prevent food, fuel and other necessities from reaching the city. despite international criticism of its human-rights record, nigeria _ apparently trying to improve its image and its clout in the region _ has become a self-appointed protector of democracy in parts of africa.

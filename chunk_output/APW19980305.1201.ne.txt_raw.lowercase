 tehran, iran (ap) _ iran has declined an invitation from the u.s. soccer federation to play a friendly match in the united states, an iranian soccer official said thursday. mohsen safai farahani, the president of iran's football federation, said the ussf sent a fax about two weeks ago, inviting iran to come to the united states ``in an all-expenses paid trip to meet the u.s. team in a friendly match.'' ``unfortunately, and because our program is fully booked and because of the long distance, we thanked them and turned the invitation down,'' farahani told reporters. however, ussf vice president and deputy commissioner of u.s. major league soccer sunil gulati said thursday that the invitation was for iran to play mexico, not the united states. ``mexico wants to play some asian teams because they have south korea in their group,'' gulati said. since mexico on occasion plays in the united states, often to reach their heavy support in southern california, the ussf acted on behalf of the mexican federation in sending out invitation letters to south korea, iran and china. gulati also approached japan verbally, he said. also attending the press conference was croatian coach tomislav ivic, who took over the iranian team from brazilian valdir vierra after iran claimed the last spot in the 32-team world cup field in france in june. ``it would have been a fantastic opportunity and we would've liked to go there but our schedule was complete and we couldn't change it,'' ivic said. the united states and iran are grouped together along with germany and yugoslavia for the first round of the world cup. ivic said the iranian team will travel to france next week to play against first division teams montpellier and nantes before returning to tehran for friendly matches against hungary, ghana and jamaica. ivic downplayed the importance of iran's world cup match with the united states. ``we want to qualify to the second round. this is our first wish. all three games are different and we need to prepare special tactics for each one. each game is important,'' ivic said. he said the roster for the finals was not complete and he was awaiting a number of players to join the camp after finishing their club duty. some 15 players, who form the backbone of the national team, are from iran's two major clubs, esteqlal and piroozi. both teams are currently engaged in asian</enamex> championships. despite the risk of losing one or more of the players to injury, farahani</enamex> said he was happy that the esteqlal</enamex> and piroozi</enamex> players were competing in regional competitions. ``we believe that playing in the league and asian</enamex> tournaments will create the best situation for the national team,'' he said.

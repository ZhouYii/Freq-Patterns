 blackburn, england (ap) _ european police and security officials devised a common strategy friday to prevent the world cup from being turned into a battleground for soccer hooligans. more than 100 delegates from 26 countries attended a seminar at ewood park, home of blackburn rovers football club, to discuss ways of combatting violent troublemakers during this summer's month-long tournament in france. with a record 32 nations taking part, teams criss-crossing the country for each game and demand for tickets far outstripping the supply, hooliganism shapes up as the world cup's biggest nightmare. ``the football hooligan is a violent criminal,'' said british home secretary jack straw. ``he is a coward who hides behind the good name of the decent supporter. my message to the hooligan is simple: we know who you are, we know what your plans are and we will do everything we can to stop you bringing disgrace and shame to this country.'' while hooliganism has been largely brought under control in england, traveling english fans continue to pose a huge security threat abroad. ``we have to deal with the tiny minority who want to use football matches as an opportunity for violence,'' straw said. ``modern professional football originated in england. i am proud that we exported the game to all parts of the world. ``but i am ashamed that we also exported football hooliganism, and that we have such experience of dealing with hooliganism in england.'' straw announced that britain was re-launching its ``hooligan hotline,'' giving fans a chance to call a toll-free number to tip off police about planned activities by soccer thugs. he said the british government was negotiating with the french to help prevent hooligans convicted in france</enamex> from then travelling back to cause further trouble during the tournament. in addition, courts in britain</enamex> have the authority to impose ``restriction orders'' on convicted hooligans, preventing them from traveling to france</enamex>. straw</enamex> said british</enamex> intelligence officers and ``police spotters'' would track known troublemakers and report their movement to french</enamex> officials. ``the french</enamex> will welcome with open arms the law-abiding fan,'' he said. ``however, they will bring the full force of the law down on those who cause trouble and there will be 24 hour judges near the stadia to mete out swift justice to the hooligan.'' with england</enamex> allocated only 9,128 tickets for its first three games, there are fears that large number of fans will travel to france</enamex> to purchase tickets on the blackmarket. ``the sale of tickets to rival fans in the same part of the ground is just a simple recipe for disaster,'' straw</enamex> said.

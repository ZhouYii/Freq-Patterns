 jerusalem (ap) _ israel will ask the united states to delay a military strike against iraq until the jewish state is fully prepared for a possible iraqi attack with non-conventional weapons, the defense minister said in remarks published friday. also friday, the united states announced that it sent a team from the center for disease control to assist the palestinian authority in assessing its ability to protect its population in the event of a biological or chemical weapon attack by iraq. the u.s. ambassador to israel, edward walker, assured defense minister yitzhak mordechai in a meeting that israel would have enough time to properly prepare. israel is equipping its residents with gas masks and preparing kits with antidotes. gabi ofir, the commander of israel's distribution centers told israel radio that 300,000 gas mask kits have been dispensed to the public in the last several weeks. israel has been scrambling to buy more masks abroad. after a shortage of several hundred thousand gas masks, including those for young children, was discovered. germany has agreed to lend israel 180,000 protective kits against chemical and biological weapons, and switzerland offered to lend israel another 25,000 masks. in stockholm, the swedish government announced it has authorized the sale of up to 80,000 gas masks for children. government spokesman moshe fogel said israel appreciated the swiss offer, but would have to determine the masks' compatibility to israel's needs before accepting. meanwhile, an israeli delegation traveled friday to oslo to examine 200,000 gas masks the norwegian government has offered, israel radio said. prime minister benjamin netanyahu called the prime minister of the netherlands to thank him for thousands of gas masks his country has already contributed. the defense ministry said 16 planes have landed so far with protective equipment against biological and chemical warfare. mordechai said all the gas masks from abroad would arrive soon and be distributed to the public, adding that additional distribution centers would be set up next week. ``there is no reason why we would not be prepared,'' mordechai told the yediot ahronot daily. ``if, in spite of everything, we will not be ready, we will ask the united states to delay the operation.'' ``there is no certainty that they will do what we ask, but they will definitely take into consideration our readiness,'' he added. israel's armed forces chief, lt. gen. amnon lipkin-shahak, appeared on national television friday night in attempt to reassure a jittery public. ``when events are concrete and actually unfolding, we will include the entire population in the measures we decide are appropriate to take,'' shahak said in an interview with channel two television. iraqi deputy prime minister tariq aziz said earlier this week that baghdad has no intention of attacking israel even if iraq is targeted by the united states. but netanyahu said thursday that he would not rely on iraqi promises when it came to israel's security. the united states has promised to defend israel, and the daily maariv said friday that the americans had agreed to send israel special equipment for detecting chemical or biological weapons. israeli troops will go to the united states next week to train with the equipment, maariv added. several pro-iraq demonstrations have taken place in the last week in the gaza strip and the west bank despite the palestinian authority's public opposition to them. a spokesman for the arab liberation front, a palestinian group that has been organizing pro-iraq demonstrations, claimed their leader was arrested friday by the palestinian police in the gaza strip.

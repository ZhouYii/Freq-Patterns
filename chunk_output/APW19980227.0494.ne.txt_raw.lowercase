 moscow (ap) _ presidents leonid kuchma of ukraine and boris yeltsin of russia signed an economic cooperation plan friday, and yeltsin claimed they resolved even more nagging problems. russia and ukraine share similar cultures and languages, and ukraine was ruled from moscow for centuries. but while the two slavic neighbors see themselves as natural partners, their relations since the breakup of the soviet union have been bedeviled by a number of disputes _ black sea naval bases, border problems and ukraine's natural gas debts. ``we have covered the entire list of questions and discussed how we will be tackling them,'' yeltsin was quoted as saying by the itar-tass news agency. ``i must say there are no unsettled problems any more. we have solved them all.'' but his sweeping statement contained no details, and gave no indication of how the disputes could be resolved. their solution would require a compromise between the two nations' parliaments. a major dispute concerns a broad political treaty calling for border demarcation, which the two presidents signed last may. in effect, the treaty amounts to russian recognition of ukraine's sovereignty and borders, and the ukrainian parliament has already ratified it. however, russia has stalled ratification, trying to tie it to an agreement that would permit the russian navy to use a naval base on ukraine's crimean peninsula for at least 20 more years. in their joint statement issued after the talks, yeltsin and kuchma called for the fastest possible ratification of the treaty, saying it would create a ``strong legal foundation'' for bilateral ties and help stability in europe. kuchma assured yeltsin that ukraine would not join nato, yeltsin's spokesman sergei yastrzhembsky said, according to the interfax news agency. the russian leadership has staunchly opposed the western alliance's expansion into eastern europe. in their joint statement, released by the kremlin, the two leaders also pledged to consult each other regularly on their approaches to relations with nato and, in particular, their action within the framework of nato's partnership for peace program. last year, russian officials assailed ukraine for holding joint naval exercises with nato in the black sea _ an area moscow considers its own turf. kuchma has said repeatedly that ukraine would remain neutral for the foreseeable future. yeltsin and kuchma also called for developing the stagnant relations between the members of the commonwealth of independent states, a loose coalition of former soviet republics. in the past, russia has often claimed that ukraine was undermining efforts at closer cooperation within the cis. a major goal of kuchma's four-day state visit was the signing of a 10-year economic program aimed at doubling the two nations' trade turnover, which fell to dlrs 14 billion last year, down dlrs 2.5 billion from 1996. the two presidents on friday signed the plan, which calls for cooperation in the metallurgy, fuel, energy, aircraft building, missile, space and chemical industries. a major project is joint manufacturing of an-70 cargo planes, the kremlin statement said. the program also calls for coordination of economic reforms and joint improvement of social programs in the two countries, where many people have become impoverished during the chaotic post-soviet transition to capitalism. kuchma also planned to visit russian gas giant gazprom, most likely to discuss ukraine</enamex>'s dlrs 1.2 billion debt to the company.

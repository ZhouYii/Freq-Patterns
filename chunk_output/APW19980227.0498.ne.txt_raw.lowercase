 chiang mai, thailand (ap) _ the thai army is in a standoff against more than 500 burmese government troops who crossed into northern thailand in pursuit of ethnic insurgents and have refused to retreat, a thai border official said friday. the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed the burmese troops are holding their ground about five kilometers (three miles) inside thailand at the tong na village in pang ma pa district of mae hong son province. the burmese are claiming the right to be there on the basis that the area has yet to be demarcated, he said. he said about 100 of the burmese troops have been on thai soil since tuesday and 400 more troops have crossed over to thailand since then. a thai army official in the area, however, dismissed the incident as ``minor,'' insisting that only several dozen burmese troops had ``accidentally'' crossed over on wednesday but that thai soldiers had pushed them back. he said he had sent more troops to monitor the situation, as requested by provincial authorities, and insisted that everything was under control. thai officials often downplay incidents of border tension to avoid diplomatic wrangles with burma. although thai-burmese relations are generally good, disputes over the demarcation of the border, as well as the presence of burmese ethnic minority guerrillas, has led to a number of confrontations. the border official said the burmese troops were planning to attack guerrillas of the shan state army troops from thai territory and forced civilian refugees, who are about two kilometers (one mile) from the border, to return to burma. he said the thai army had requested help from border patrol police and some paramilitary ranger units, who arrived in the area with mortars and machine guns. several helicopters have been requested as well, he said. fighting between government troops and the shan state army broke out about a week ago inside burma near the city of homong, the former headquarters of opium warlord khun sa. khun sa, also known as chang qifu, surrendered to the burmese government in 1996 and is now thought to be living in rangoon. when khun sa</enamex> surrendered, burma</enamex>'s military government said most of his 10-15,000 ethnic shan troops had laid down their arms and the area was under government control. but recently, three separate shan rebel armies announced they were joining forces to continue the war against the burmese</enamex> regime. the renewed guerrilla war has been a setback for the military government in rangoon</enamex>, which has touted ceasefires with many ethnic insurgent groups as one of its accomplishments.

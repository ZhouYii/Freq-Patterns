 	   bern, switzerland (ap) _ the swiss government has rejected the compensation claim of a world war ii jewish refugee who claimed the country was responsible for his parents' deaths, it was announced thursday. 	   the federal department of finance said in a statement that the claim filed last year by charles sonabend had no legal ground. the demand related to events too far in the past, it said. 	   sonabend, 66, who now lives in london, sought 100,000 swiss francs (dlrs 69,000), saying the swiss authorities' asylum policy led to his parents' deaths. 	   in 1942, the sonabend family fled to neutral switzerland from nazi-occupied belgium. according to a swiss television report in october, the family was arrested and deported to france two days later. sonabend's parents later died at the auschwitz concentration camp. 	   the department said sonabend can appeal to switzerland's supreme court. 	   ``the federal authorities, unlike the nazi regime, didn't commit war crimes,'' the department said. ``the government expresses its deeply felt sympathy and regret, independently of the judicial assessment of the request and of the historical evaluation of the circumstances.'' 	   sonabend's attorney, marc richter, said in a statement that he will appeal. he described as ``cheap'' the government's justification for turning down the claim. 	   surrounded by germany, nazi-occupied france and nazi-allied italy, wartime switzerland took in nearly 30,000 jews. but it turned away an equal number, many of them to a certain death. 	   switzerland has been accused of acting as hitler's banker, and its banks has been criticized for dragging their feet over allowing holocaust victims' heirs access to dormant accounts. but it has also been praised for its efforts to investigate fully what happened and make amends for any wrongdoing. 	   the committee of independent historians set up to investigate switzerland's wartime past said thursday that its full report on the country's gold transactions with the nazi regime will be released april 7. 	   the panel's preliminary report in december said switzerland was involved in 76 percent of nazi germany's gold transactions during world war ii. it added that swiss banks handled dlrs 450 million in nazi gold _ a portion of which had been looted. 	   switzerland's major banks have set up a fund to help needy survivors of the holocaust, especially those still living in eastern europe.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CANBERRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>) _ Turning its back on 210 years of
loyalty to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> royal family, a constitutional convention
voted overwhelmingly Friday to make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> a republic under its
own president.
Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Howard</ENAMEX>, a monarchist himself, promised to
put the question to a national referendum next year after
convention delegates voted 89-52 for a republic, with 11
abstentions.
Spontaneous applause echoed through the chamber and public
galleries as the crucial vote passed by a wide margin.
``I want a referendum,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> said. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australian</ENAMEX> people
are owed the opportunity of expressing an opinion on this.''
``It would be a travesty in common sense terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australian</ENAMEX>
democracy for that proposition not to be put to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australian</ENAMEX>
people,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> said.
Even in his own Cabinet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> is becoming increasingly
isolated with his monarchist stance. Treasurer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Costello</ENAMEX>,
Environment Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hill</ENAMEX> and Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daryl
Williams</ENAMEX> all voted to support the republic Friday.
``This convention will be seen as a turning point in our
history,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian Republican Movement</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary
Delahunty</ENAMEX> said.
Pro-republicans hope to have an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australian</ENAMEX> president by the
opening of the 2000 Olympics and the 100th anniversary of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australian</ENAMEX> federation.
Calling for an amended constitution with a new preamble, to be
written by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australian</ENAMEX> poets, republican <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Holmes a Court</ENAMEX> said,
``We need the smell of eucalyptus in this, and the feel of red
dust.''
Monarchists hope to defeat the republic at the referendum.
``The phony war has finished and the real referendum campaign
has clearly begun,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy</ENAMEX>
executive director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry Jones</ENAMEX> said.
``Well may we say `God save the Queen,' for nothing will save
the republic,'' outraged monarchist delegate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mitchell</ENAMEX> said.
``The idea of a republic will fall to dust through the grace of
almighty God.''
Polls have shown public support for a republic increasing,
rising from about 35 percent several years ago to about 51 percent
this year, as pro-monarchist sentiment diminishes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> has been independent since 1901, but like many
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> nations it still recognizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> monarch as its
head of state.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Elizabeth II</ENAMEX> is taking a great interest in the
convention.
``She is, I can assure you, from what I've been told, she's
following the thing very closely and taking the view it's our
business.
``It's no secret that she's indicated to me ... she is a 20th
century democrat, understands that the role of the crown in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> rests in the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australian</ENAMEX> people as it has for
almost a hundred years.''
The model for a republic, adopted over bitter objections from
those advocating direct election of a president, is for
presidential nominations to be made with public input and the
winning candidate decided by a two-thirds majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>.
Former prime minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Keating</ENAMEX>, who put the republic issue
in the spotlight in his unsuccessful 1996 campaign for re-election,
welcomed the result.
``This is an important step along the path towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>
claiming its full sovereignty, and due recognition that the
monarchy can no longer serve us appropriately,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> said.

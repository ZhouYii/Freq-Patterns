<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAGHDAD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>) _ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s deputy foreign minister attacked
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> National Security Advisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Berger</ENAMEX> Friday, accusing him of
``lies and deception.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riyadh al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> picked his way through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>'s press conference
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> hours earlier, criticizing the security advisor's
assertion that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> had been repeatedly in ``material breach'' of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX> resolutions.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> challenges (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>) to produce one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX>
resolution using those two words,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> told reporters in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>.
He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> might not have been concerned with reality,
because he had indicated that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> did not have the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX>'s unanimous support for a military strike, it
would go ahead anyway.
``Everybody knows that under the charter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>,
the five permanent members have a special responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security and there are three
permanent members _ namely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> _ who do not
want war, so unanimity does not exist,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Qaysi</ENAMEX> said.
The deputy foreign minister accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> of being part of a
campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
``This campaign is being conducted on the basis of lies and
deception and should not be taken by anyone in the world as being a
justifiable basis for war.''
``This is exactly what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, as supported by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, are trying to achieve.''

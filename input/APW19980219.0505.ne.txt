	   <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ATHENS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>) _ A powerful bomb blast Thursday damaged an
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">American</ENAMEX> car dealership in a possible protest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military
confrontation with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
	   The pre-dawn explosion caused heavy damage to the showroom and
offices of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> dealership about 12 kilometers (seven
miles) north of central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>. There were no injuries.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greek</ENAMEX> media, quoting police sources, said there was
speculation the attack was a protest of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military
strikes against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is damanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>
give full access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> weapons inspectors.
	   Government spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dimitris Reppas</ENAMEX> said it was ``premature''
to connect the attack with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military build-up in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>.
	   <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Burns</ENAMEX>, who met with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greek</ENAMEX> police
officials in a pre-scheduled courtesy visit, told reporters that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> authorities had no direct information on reports that the
blast was linked to the standoff with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
	   There have been a series of bombings around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> in recent
months. On Feb. 3, two bombs exploded outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>
restaurants, causing damage but no injuries.

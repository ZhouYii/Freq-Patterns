<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">JERUSALEM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>) _ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> will ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to delay a
military strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> until the Jewish state is fully
prepared for a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX> attack with non-conventional weapons,
the defense minister said in remarks published Friday.
Also Friday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> announced that it sent a team
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Disease Control</ENAMEX> to assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestinian
Authority</ENAMEX> in assessing its ability to protect its population in the
event of a biological or chemical weapon attack by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Walker</ENAMEX>, assured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yitzhak Mordechai</ENAMEX> in a meeting that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> would have
enough time to properly prepare.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is equipping its residents with gas masks and preparing
kits with antidotes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabi Ofir</ENAMEX>, the commander of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s distribution centers told
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israel Radio</ENAMEX> that 300,000 gas mask kits have been dispensed to the
public in the last several weeks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has been scrambling to buy more masks abroad. after a
shortage of several hundred thousand gas masks, including those for
young children, was discovered.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> has agreed to lend <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 180,000 protective kits
against chemical and biological weapons, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> offered to
lend <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> another 25,000 masks.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Swedish</ENAMEX> government announced it has authorized
the sale of up to 80,000 gas masks for children.
Government spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moshe Fogel</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> appreciated the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Swiss</ENAMEX> offer, but would have to determine the masks' compatibility
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s needs before accepting.
Meanwhile, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israeli</ENAMEX> delegation traveled Friday to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX> to
examine 200,000 gas masks the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norwegian</ENAMEX> government has offered,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israel radio</ENAMEX> said.
Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Netanyahu</ENAMEX> called the prime minister of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> to thank him for thousands of gas masks his country
has already contributed.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> said 16 planes have landed so far with
protective equipment against biological and chemical warfare.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mordechai</ENAMEX> said all the gas masks from abroad would arrive soon and
be distributed to the public, adding that additional distribution
centers would be set up next week.
``There is no reason why we would not be prepared,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mordechai</ENAMEX>
told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yediot Ahronot daily</ENAMEX>. ``If, in spite of everything, we
will not be ready, we will ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to delay the
operation.''
``There is no certainty that they will do what we ask, but they
will definitely take into consideration our readiness,'' he added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s armed forces chief, Lt. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amnon Lipkin-Shahak</ENAMEX>,
appeared on national television Friday night in attempt to reassure
a jittery public.
``When events are concrete and actually unfolding, we will
include the entire population in the measures we decide are
appropriate to take,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shahak</ENAMEX> said in an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel Two
Television</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX> Deputy Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tariq Aziz</ENAMEX> said earlier this week
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE"><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX></ENAMEX> has no intention of attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> even if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is
targeted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> said Thursday that he would not rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX>
promises when it came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s security.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has promised to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, and the daily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maariv</ENAMEX> said Friday that the Americans had agreed to send <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
special equipment for detecting chemical or biological weapons.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israeli</ENAMEX> troops will go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> next week to train
with the equipment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maariv</ENAMEX> added.
Several pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> demonstrations have taken place in the last
week in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Bank</ENAMEX> despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestinian
Authority</ENAMEX>'s public opposition to them.
A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab Liberation Front</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestinian</ENAMEX> group
that has been organizing pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> demonstrations, claimed their
leader was arrested Friday by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestinian</ENAMEX> police in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza
Strip</ENAMEX>.

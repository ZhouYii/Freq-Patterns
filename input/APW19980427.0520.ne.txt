Turkey asks EU to keep out of dispute over Aegean islets
</HEADLINE>

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ANKARA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>) _ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">European Union</ENAMEX> on Monday
to refrain from approving the inclusion of disputed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> islets
into the union's environmental programs by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, have long running disputes over air, sea and
seabed mineral rights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> and both lay claims to several
uninhabited rocky islets.
``This is a very delicate matter and our call on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EU</ENAMEX> is to
use its common sense and not allow itself to be used by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sermet Atacanli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> spokesman, told a news
conference.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> has been including the disputed
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> islands in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EU</ENAMEX> environmental programs on waste, waste water,
natural habitats and wild birds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atacanli</ENAMEX> did not name any specific island.
He said there were several islets, rocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean Sea</ENAMEX> whose
sovereignty had not been transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> by international
treaties.
The two countries came close to war in February 1996 over claims
to rocky islets, called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kardak</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Imia</ENAMEX> in Greek). Last-minute
mediation by the international community deterred armed conflict.
``This issue must be resolved by talks together,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atacanli</ENAMEX>
said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> will not accept any unilateral actions that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>
would take on these geographical formations.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atacanli</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> has relayed its opposition over the issue
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">European Union</ENAMEX>.

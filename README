A small system to mine some patterns.
Components :
    raw_parser = target format of ACE_NE_all/*/nwire tagged files. Generate raw
    text and map of phrase->label.
    
    eclat = third party lib for association rule mining and freq pattern mining.
    
    patterns = takes many raw texts and dictionaries and output all patterns

    (Stanford POS = POS labels on text files. Not used)

To demo : /find_patterns.sh input_raw out_dir
After running, out_dir/eclat gives all the patterns, out_dir/eclat_patterns
gives all the patterns that meet some minimum pattern length and support.

The parameters for frequent pattern mining can be tuned in find_patterns.sh.
